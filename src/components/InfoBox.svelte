        Exploitation, pollution, nontransparent supply chains, and rediculous production times.
        <b>The fashion industry is a dinosaur</b>.
        This is a shame because we can do better.
        With modern technology, there is no lack of opportunity to do things in a safer, faster and cleaner way.

        At Rodinia Generation, <b>we are developing the worlds first <em>Micro Fashion Factory</em></b>.
